# rye-tui

> Rye meets Textual. Manage your python projects with a Tui

rye-tui is a CLI tool to manage your [rye] projects. It offers a UI to interact with your projects.

## Currently still under development
A 0.2.0 version is already released on [PyPi]

## Installation

You can already install a first release with one of the three options:

```bash
pip install rye-tui
```

```bash
pipx install rye-tui
```

```bash
rye install rye-tui
```
I recommend using [pipx] or [rye] to install CLI Tools into an isolated environment.

## Usage

Once installed, you can open the tui with
```bash
trye
```

On first execution a configuration file is created. Afterwards you can run `trye` again to get into the tui view.

The configuration file contains a list of the paths of your rye-managed pojects.
Also a project home directory is defined (default: `HOMEPATH`), which helps initializing new projects under a certain location.

Rye-Tui is following the [XDG] basedir-spec. Therefore the configuration file is located under your OS specific `config_user_dir`.


## Features

Rye-Tui is divided into 3 Tabs:
1. Projects
2. General
3. Config

### Projects Tab
The Projects Tab holds all your rye projects and gives you an overview to each project based on the `pyproject.toml` and installed packages.
`Edit`- Button function to open pyproject.toml is still missing currently.

`rye add` and  `rye add --dev` is already supported, flags are still missing currently.

### General Tab
The General Tab has an input field to define your project-home path, which acts as an default location, to easily create a new project there.
Furthermore you get an overview over your globally installed tools including version and available scripts.
The final section lists all installed toolchain.

### Config Tab
The Config Tab can be used to change rye's underlying config.
`default` and `sources` sections functionality is still missing currently
